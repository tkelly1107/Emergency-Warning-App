### This github repository was originally created by Timoteo Kelly for an emergency warning mobile applications research project with Dr. Bonaretti at Nova Southeastern University, between January 2022 and May 2023. 
### It contains several scripts and guides for scraping and storing google application reviews in Python, processing, analysis and data viz in R, and text classification with MonkeyLearn.

#### [How to Scrape and Store Google Reviews from Multiple Apps with Python and MongoDB](https://github.com/tkelly1107/Emergency-Warning-App/blob/main/code/Python%20Code/google_scraper_mongodb.ipynb/)
#### [Data Cleaning, Manipulation, Visualizations, Exploratory Analysis in R](https://github.com/tkelly1107/Emergency-Warning-App/tree/main/code/R%20Code/)


Most of the guides have been created in jupyter notebooks so I recommend you download the files and open them in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) if you do not already have jupyter notebook installed. (Google Colab requires no installation, just a google account).
