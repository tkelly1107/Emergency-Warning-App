# Scrape Google Reviews from Multiple Apps with Python
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### This github repository contains several scripts and guides for scraping google application reviews with the google play scraper API package for Python. It also contains scripts for data cleaning, manipulations, visualizations and exploratory analysis in R. 
### These scripts were originally created for an emergency warning mobile applications research project with Dr. Bonaretti at Nova Southeastern University, between March and December 2022.

Most of the guides have been created in jupyter notebooks so I recommend you download the files and open them in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) if you do not already have jupyter notebook installed. (Google Colab requires no installation, just a google account).
