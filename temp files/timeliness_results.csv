Resize; ad.  Change settings; ad.  Pan; ad.  Zoom;ad.  Every 20 seconds; ad.... And these full page ads are in addition to a bottom banner ad...   Everyone who complains about this gets a completely canned response from Apalon so that just tells me Apalon won't make changes and isn't listening.  If it weren't for the ad frequency I'd rate it much higher (5).  In its current state I'd rate it (2), but I'm giving it (1) star because of Apalon's canned responses to all PREVIOUS reviews that note this absurd ad frequency.    Let's see how they respond to me because I think that my advice to them to tone the ads down is legitimate considering. If they acknowledge that I'll reevaluate my review rating and I'll bump my review to (2).  I'll bump to a (5) once ads are actually served at a ""normal free version rate.""   Finally, as a developer myself, I get it, the free version has ads and there needs to be a catalyst to upgrade.  That said, the frequency is just too high; obscenely high.  If I can't evaluate the app experience without getting served an ad every 10-20 seconds I won't upgrade and will just find an alternative.

It is just terrible, it's gotten way too busy and clunky. You can no longer simply just scroll through to see what you need. Each different screen is a full swipe to reach and if you dont swipe fully enough for it, it reverts back to the screen you were on. White background is as stated by others just gross. I've found when reading through the forecasts I'm losing focus and forgetting what I've read for what day, and whether it is morning or evening. Seriously the delivery of the information has gotten really long and bulky. My biggest complaints by fair is the old hourly display where you could see practically the whole day laid out on your screen is gone. Now you have scroll across your screen and you dont see nearly as much at once. And lastly the getting rid of the 15 day forecast on one viewable screen might just be the straw that broke the camel's back for me. I keep seeing the developers say just ""click the daily tab above the graph to see all 15 days at a glance."" This not entirely accurate. Yes, all 15 days are there, but you have to swipe across your screen multiple times to see all 15 days. You don't see them all lined up together at once, so once again I'm finding I don't remember what the weather was like at the beginning of the week while looking at the end of the week.

I've noticed that when I have the app turned on my phone goes from full charge to 15% within a few hours. Even with power saving enabled and the app notifications turned off this app uses enough battery power to drain my phone in a few hours.
